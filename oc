1. Remove the existing NVIDIA driver using DNF
Use the following command to purge all installed NVIDIA packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo dnf remove '*nvidia*'
This command will remove all packages related to NVIDIA, including drivers, libraries, and dependencies.

2. Enable the RPM Fusion repository (for proprietary drivers)
If you haven't already enabled RPM Fusion, run these commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
3. Install the latest NVIDIA driver
Once RPM Fusion is set up, install the NVIDIA driver:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia
This will install the driver and automatically build kernel modules.
To ensure kernel modules are up to date, you can also run:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo akmods --force
4. Reboot your system
Reboot your machine to apply the changes:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo reboot
5. Verify the installation
After rebooting, check if the NVIDIA driver is working:

bash
Copy
Edit
nvidia-smi
This process should successfully update and apply the NVIDIA driver on a system using DNF.
