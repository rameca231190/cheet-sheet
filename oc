3. Enable Additional RHEL Repositories
Ensure all relevant repositories for your system version are enabled:

bash
Copy
Edit
subscription-manager repos --list-enabled
If needed, enable specific repositories:

bash
Copy
Edit
subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms \
                           --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms \
                           --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-highavailability-rpms
4. Use RHEL EUS (Extended Update Support) or HTB (Hotfix) Repos
Some kernel versions might be available in Extended Update Support or Hotfix repositories:

bash
Copy
Edit
subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-eus-rpms
subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-htb-rpms
After enabling, refresh and check for the package:

bash
Copy
Edit
yum clean all
yum makecache
yum list kernel-devel --showduplicates
5. Manually Sync with the Red Hat CDN
Sometimes the system may not have the latest repository metadata. Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
subscription-manager clean
yum clean all
yum repolist
Then try installing again:

bash
Copy
Edit
yum install kernel-devel-4.18.0-553.33.1.el8_10.x86_64
6. Check Red Hat Customer Portal for the Package
If the package is not yet available in the repositories, it might not have been published or synchronized with your region yet. You can manually check on the Red Hat Customer Portal to confirm if the version exists.

If it's available, your admin might need to synchronize repositories or apply an update.

7. Contact Red Hat Support
If the specific kernel version is critical for your use case and isn't available through standard repos, contact Red Hat Support to inquire about the availability or request access to an updated repo.

bash
Copy
Edit
subscription-manager service-level --set=Premium
Then reach out via:

Red Hat Support Portal
Command-line tool to open a support case:
bash
Copy
Edit
redhat-support-tool create --product="Red Hat Enterprise Linux" --version="8"
If none of these steps work, it's likely that your organizationâ€™s repository mirror is not yet updated with the latest package. Let me know if you'd like to troubleshoot further.
