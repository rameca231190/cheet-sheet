Solution Steps:
1. Check for available kernel versions:
First, verify which versions of kernel-devel are available in the enabled repositories:

bash
Copy
Edit
yum list available kernel-devel --showduplicates | grep 4.18.0
This will show all available versions in your repositories. If 4.18.0-553.33.1.el8_10.x86_64 is not listed, it means it's not yet available in your current repo configuration.

2. Update the repository metadata:
Force yum to refresh the repository metadata and check again:

bash
Copy
Edit
yum clean all
yum makecache fast
Then try searching for the package again:

bash
Copy
Edit
yum search kernel-devel
3. Check if the required package is available from subscription services (if applicable):
If you are using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), make sure your system is properly registered and the subscription is attached:

bash
Copy
Edit
subscription-manager refresh
subscription-manager list --available
If necessary, enable additional repos:

bash
Copy
Edit
subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms
subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
4. Enable specific repository versions (if available):
If your system is using CentOS Stream or RHEL minor versions, check if a more specific repo version exists:

bash
Copy
Edit
yum-config-manager --enable rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-eus-rpms
yum-config-manager --enable rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-htb-rpms
5. Attempt to install the closest available version:
If version 4.18.0-553.33.1 is not available, and if your task allows it, you might consider using the available version (4.18.0-553.31.1). You can try:

bash
Copy
Edit
yum install kernel-devel-4.18.0-553.31.1.el8_10.x86_64
However, be cautious, as using a different version of kernel-devel may cause compatibility issues when compiling kernel modules.

6. Consider enabling CentOS Vault or older repositories (for CentOS users):
If you are on CentOS, the package may be available in archived repositories. You can check and enable CentOS Vault:

bash
Copy
Edit
yum-config-manager --add-repo http://vault.centos.org/8.5.2111/BaseOS/x86_64/os/
yum-config-manager --enable vault
7. Check with your system administrator or mirror policies:
If your organization manages the repository mirrors, the latest kernel package may not have been synced yet. Contact the admin to request an update or mirror sync.

If none of these options work, your only option might be to manually download the RPM through an allowed method (e.g., via an intermediary server). Let me know if you need help exploring that.
